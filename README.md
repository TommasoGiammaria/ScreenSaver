# SCREEN SAVER
--UNDER DEVELOPMENT--

## description
Idea for a game with lines inside a circular field (for now it's just a screen saver)
It generates circular and/or elliptical arcs inside a circle using different colors.
The code is made using the pygame libraries

curve_utils handles curve generation, producing a tuple of vector2 points, while draw_utils handles the drawing functions


## to be implemented
Two possible operations:
- standard (already present) screen saver which stops when mouse is moved
- keyboard control to change curve generation parameters

## TO DO
- fix curve stopping at endpoints (when a curve ends touching the circle)
